# Indian Engineering Students: Placement & Career Readiness Dataset (2026)

> **15,000 synthetic engineering student records designed for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning, and Educational Analytics.**

---

## Overview

Engineering placements remain one of the most important milestones for students across India. Factors such as academic performance, technical skills, internships, communication abilities, and extracurricular involvement often influence placement outcomes in different ways.

The **Indian Engineering Students: Placement & Career Readiness Dataset (2026)** was created to provide a realistic and well-structured dataset that enables students, educators, and data science practitioners to explore these relationships through data.

This dataset contains **15,000 records** and **25 features**, covering multiple aspects of a student's academic and professional profile. It is intended for educational use and supports a wide range of machine learning and analytical workflows.

> **Note:** All records are synthetically generated. No real student information has been used in the creation of this dataset.

## Why This Dataset?

Many publicly available placement datasets are either:

* Very small in size
* Missing documentation
* Limited to a few attributes
* Difficult to use for machine learning projects
* Inconsistent in terms of data quality

This dataset was designed with the following goals in mind:

* Provide realistic placement trends.
* Support end-to-end machine learning workflows.
* Include meaningful relationships between features.
* Offer sufficient scale for EDA and model development.
* Serve as a learning resource for students and educators.
